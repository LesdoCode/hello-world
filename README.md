# hello-world
This is a repository new ideas and sharing code as well as testing code.

Hi fellow earthlings. About me:
My name is Tebogo and my surname is Lemekoana.
I can't wait to get past this git and github thing so I can go into coding.
I hate Javascript though, I found it very complex  when I learnt it for the first time a while ago, I love python django and C# ASP.NET as well as C++ and Java. 
My head thinks C and C++ is a really complex and low level language with it's use cases very limited vs it's complexity as opposed to it's high level competitors like C# and Java. Am I missing something? I think it's too lowlevel for general stuff. I would definately recomend and appreciate it in automotive, robotics, and building opperating systems where we really need to interface with hardware alittle more intimately than we would in HL languages. Also audio equipment and software.

That's abit of my mind there, hope it makes sense.

But I will definately put in my best efforts for this Javascript thing, and all my past experiences with it aside. I love the assembly language too, SQL, and enjoy problem solving and super complex greedy algorithms. 

I had bad technical problems earlieer on which cost me about 2hrs of bootcamp and learning, but I'm back on my feet running.
I think that's about it for now.
Goodbye!
